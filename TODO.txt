Now that the basic server is working it is time to establish specific
things I need to do.

o add continuing and queued work support per mailbox
o break up resync all in to:
  o find new folders
  o resync on folders that have not been resync'd in <n> (five?) minutes
  o expire active folders that are around past their expiry
o add 'MailboxInconsistency' exception and handlers at the client.py
  that when they get this have a better idea what to do (things like
  'send a BAD to the client, 'be silent and retry command',
  'disconnect client')
o write tool to split huge mailboxes in to mailbox + sub-mailbox by
  year, keeping the last 1,000 messages in the current folder.
o add SSL support
o add proper unix account authentication support
  o it must support no more than three bad auths in 90 seconds
