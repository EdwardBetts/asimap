Now that the basic server is working it is time to establish specific
things I need to do.

* break up resync all in to:
  * find new folders
  * resync on folders that have not been resync'd in <n> (five?) minutes
  * expire active folders that are around past their expiry

o add continuing and queued work support per mailbox

o add 'MailboxInconsistency' exception and handlers at the client.py
  that when they get this have a better idea what to do (things like
  'send a BAD to the client, 'be silent and retry command',
  'disconnect client')

o write tool to split huge mailboxes in to mailbox + sub-mailbox by
  year, keeping the last 1,000 messages in the current folder.

o add SSL support

o add proper unix account authentication support
  o it must support no more than three bad auths in 90 seconds

o add command/response tracing facility and hook it into the ability
  to run regression tests against a running server.

o write a unit test suite for the components we can test separately
  (like IMAP message parsing, search & fetch over a set of test
  messages.)
